`Warning: ReactDOM.render is no longer supported in React 18. Use createRoot instead. Until you switch to the new API, your app will behave as if it's running React 17. Learn more: https://reactjs.org/link/switch-to-createroot`

Quiz!

1. What is a React component?
reusable components

2. What's wrong with this code?
```
function myComponent() {
    return (
        <small>I'm tiny text!</small>
    )
}
```
it needs to be PascalCase: `MyComponent`
3. What's wrong with this code?
```
function Header() {
    return (
        <header>
            <nav>
                <img src="./react-logo.png" width="40px" />
            </nav>
        </header>
    )
}
ReactDOM.render(Header(), document.getElementById("root"))
```
use : <Header />


1. What do props help us accomplish?
it stands for proprty attribute, it help in making the component dynamic


2. How do you pass a prop into a component?
`function ComponentName(prop)`


3. Can I pass a custom prop (e.g. `blahblahblah={true}`) to a native
   DOM element? (e.g. <div blahblahblah={true}>) Why or why not?
nope, it is unique to JSX element


4. How do I receive props in a component?
function Navbar(prop) {
    return (
        <header>
            prop.comp
        </header>
    )
}


5. What data type is `props` when the component receives it?
object

- state
1. How would you describe the concept of "state"?
A way for React to remember saved values from within a component.
This is similar to declaring variables from within a component,
with a few added bonuses (which we'll get to later)


2. When would you want to use props instead of state?
Anytime you want to pass data into a component so that
component can determine what will get displayed on the
screen.


3. When would you want to use state instead of props?
Anytime you want a component to maintain some values from
within the component. (And "remember" those values even
when React re-renders the component).


4. What does "immutable" mean? Are props immutable? Is state immutable?
Unchanging. Props are immutable. State is mutable.

    )
}

```


1. In a vanilla JS app, at what point in the form submission
   process do you gather all the data from the filled-out form?
Right before the form is submitted.


2. In a React app, when do you gather all the data from
   the filled-out form?
As the form is being filled out. The data is all held in local state.


3. Which attribute in the form elements (value, name, onChange, etc.)
   should match the property name being held in state for that input?
`name` property.


4. What's different about saving the data from a checkbox element
   vs. other form elements?
A checkbox uses the `checked` property to determine what should
be saved in state. Other form elements use the `value` property instead.


5. How do you watch for a form submit? How can you trigger
   a form submit?
- Can watch for the submit with an onSubmit handler on the `form` element.
- Can trigger the form submit with a button click.


1. What is a "side effect" in React? What are some examples?
- Any code that affects an outside system.
- local storage, API, websockets, two states to keep in sync


2. What is NOT a "side effect" in React? Examples?
- Anything that React is in charge of.
- Maintaining state, keeping the UI in sync with the data, 
  render DOM elements


3. When does React run your useEffect function? When does it NOT run
   the effect function?
- As soon as the component loads (first render)
- On every re-render of the component (assuming no dependencies array)
- Will NOT run the effect when the values of the dependencies in the
  array stay the same between renders


4. How would you explain what the "dependecies array" is?
- Second paramter to the useEffect function
- A way for React to know whether it should re-run the effect function

# useEffect cleaning 
```js
import React from "react"

export default function WindowTracker() {
    
    const [windowWidth, setWindowWidth] = React.useState(window.innerWidth)
    
    React.useEffect(() => {
        function watchWidth() {
            console.log("Setting up...")
            setWindowWidth(window.innerWidth)
        }
        
        window.addEventListener("resize", watchWidth)
        
        return function() {
            console.log("Cleaning up...")
            window.removeEventListener("resize", watchWidth)
        }
    }, [])
    
    return (
        <h1>Window width: {windowWidth}</h1>
    )
}

```
