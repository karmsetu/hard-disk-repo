`You are using the in-browser Babel transformer. Be sure to precompile your scripts for production - https://babeljs.io/docs/setup/`

## warning'01
`Warning: ReactDOM.render is no longer supported in React 18. Use createRoot instead. Until you switch to the new API, your app will behave as if it's running React 17. Learn more: https://reactjs.org/link/switch-to-createroot`

Quiz!

1. What is a React component?
reusable components

2. What's wrong with this code?
```
function myComponent() {
    return (
        <small>I'm tiny text!</small>
    )
}
```
it needs to be PascalCase: `MyComponent`
3. What's wrong with this code?
```
function Header() {
    return (
        <header>
            <nav>
                <img src="./react-logo.png" width="40px" />
            </nav>
        </header>
    )
}
ReactDOM.render(Header(), document.getElementById("root"))
```
use : <Header />


1. What do props help us accomplish?
it stands for proprty attribute, it help in making the component dynamic


2. How do you pass a prop into a component?
`function ComponentName(prop)`


3. Can I pass a custom prop (e.g. `blahblahblah={true}`) to a native
   DOM element? (e.g. <div blahblahblah={true}>) Why or why not?
nope, it is unique to JSX element


4. How do I receive props in a component?
function Navbar(prop) {
    return (
        <header>
            prop.comp
        </header>
    )
}


5. What data type is `props` when the component receives it?
object

- state
1. How would you describe the concept of "state"?
A way for React to remember saved values from within a component.
This is similar to declaring variables from within a component,
with a few added bonuses (which we'll get to later)


2. When would you want to use props instead of state?
Anytime you want to pass data into a component so that
component can determine what will get displayed on the
screen.


3. When would you want to use state instead of props?
Anytime you want a component to maintain some values from
within the component. (And "remember" those values even
when React re-renders the component).


4. What does "immutable" mean? Are props immutable? Is state immutable?
Unchanging. Props are immutable. State is mutable.
